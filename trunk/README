The aim of this project is to provide Xlib and XCB binding for the Free Pascal
compiler, while binding only headers that where not binded until now.

This project is releases by BSD/X.net license. Because the X.org license was 
revoked, I'm using the BSD license because it is the close to the X.org license.

I hope this project will be part of the Free Pascal packages under x11/ 
directory, however if not, you can use this repository.
